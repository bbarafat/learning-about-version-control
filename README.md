Learning about Version Control

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I like version control because it helps me keep track of the changes that have been made, and also makes it easy to collaborate with others and also potentially roll back to previous versions if needed.

The most challenging part of using version control is mainly the syntax of git commands as well as resolving conflicts when they arise.
